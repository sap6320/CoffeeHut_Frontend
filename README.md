1. Jamie wants to manage product descriptions and the related pictures using the product_catalog.md file.
2. He wants to create pretty looking FeaturedProducts.md file with a selected subset of products, descriptions and their prices. He wants to promote specific products listed in this file on a daily basis. He needs to maintain this file for every weekday and yet have access to the versions of the previously created file.
3. He also wants a place where he could safely modify his discount_plans.md without affecting his current set of plans.
